## Adding a new third-party dependency?

1. Drop the verbatim upstream license text into
   `LICENSES/<name>-<SPDX-id>.txt`.
2. Add an entry to this file with: name, upstream URL, version,
   license SPDX identifier, link mode (static / dynamic), and a
   pointer to the license copy.
3. If the new component is under a copyleft license (LGPL, GPL,
   MPL, …), add the corresponding §6 / source-availability
   treatment to `doc/LGPL-COMPLIANCE.md`.
