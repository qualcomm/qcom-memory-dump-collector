# LGPL Compliance Guide for qmdc

`qmdc` (Qualcomm Memory Dump Collector) is licensed under the
**BSD 3-Clause Clear License**, but it dynamically links against
**libusb-1.0**, which is licensed under the **GNU Lesser General
Public License v2.1 or later** (LGPL-2.1-or-later). Dynamic linking
triggers specific LGPL obligations on anyone who **distributes a
qmdc binary**.

This document captures:

1. What the LGPL obligations are and *why* they apply here.
2. How the qmdc project itself satisfies them.
3. What **downstream redistributors** (anyone shipping `qmdc.exe`
   or the `qmdc` Linux binary to end users) have to do on top.

This is general engineering guidance; it is not legal advice.
If you are redistributing qmdc in a commercial product, have your
legal team review the compliance bundle before shipping.

## 1. What LGPL §6 actually requires

The relevant text is LGPL-2.1 §6. A work that *uses* the Library —
i.e., a binary that links against libusb, whether statically or
dynamically — is called a "work that uses the Library" and may be
distributed under these conditions:

| Obligation | Source | Applies when distributing… |
|---|---|---|
| A. Give prominent notice that the work uses the Library and is covered by LGPL. | §6 para. 1 | a binary that links libusb (any link mode) |
| B. Accompany the binary with the LGPL-2.1 license text. | §6 para. 1 | a binary that contains libusb bytes (static or dynamic) |
| C. Provide access to the *corresponding* libusb source (exact version, including any modifications, under LGPL). | §6 para. 1 + §4 | a binary that contains libusb bytes |
| D. Enable the recipient to **relink** the combined work against a modified libusb. This is the core clause. | §6(a) and §6(b) | a binary that contains libusb bytes |
| E. Do not obstruct the recipient's ability to substitute a modified libusb (no signature/version pinning). | §6(b) + §6 para. 4 | any binary that links libusb dynamically |

§6(a) lets you satisfy D by shipping the complete object files of
the non-libusb part of the work (your code), plus any scripts /
data needed to re-run the linker.

§6(b) lets you satisfy D by using a "shared library mechanism" —
dynamic linking — so the user can drop in a new `libusb-1.0.dll` /
`libusb-1.0.so` without relinking.

**qmdc uses dynamic linking (§6(b))**: since qmdc dynamically links
libusb, obligation D is satisfied by the shared library mechanism —
the user can simply replace `libusb-1.0.dll` / `libusb-1.0.so`
with a modified version without rebuilding qmdc.

---

## 2. How qmdc itself complies (with dynamic linking)

| Obligation | How qmdc handles it |
|---|---|
| A. Prominent notice | `README.md` has a "Third-party components" section pointing at `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Every binary release (GitHub Releases asset) must include both files. |
| B. LGPL text | `LICENSES/libusb-1.0-LGPL-2.1.txt` is in the repo and must be bundled into every binary release. |
| C. libusb source access | `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` gives the exact libusb release tag. The version is unmodified, so the upstream tag URL satisfies §6 §4. If qmdc ever patches libusb, those patches must be placed under `src/qds/libusb/patches/` and the notice file updated. |
| D. Relink ability (§6(b)) | Auto-satisfied via dynamic linking: the user can replace `libusb-1.0.dll` (Windows) or `libusb-1.0.so` (Linux) with a modified version without relinking qmdc. |
| E. No obstruction | qmdc does not check any signature/hash of `libusb-1.0.dll` / `libusb-1.0.so` at runtime. |

### What qmdc ships in every release

Every release artifact (installer, zip, tarball) must contain:

```
<artifact root>/
├── qmdc.exe (or qmdc)
├── LICENSE.txt                         (qmdc's own BSD-3-Clause-Clear)
├── THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
└── LICENSES/
    └── libusb-1.0-LGPL-2.1.txt
```

Since qmdc now dynamically links libusb, releases that ship
`libusb-1.0.dll` (Windows) or `libusb-1.0.so` (Linux) alongside the
binary are also distributing libusb bits and must include the same
three files next to the shared library.

---

## 3. What **downstream redistributors** of qmdc binaries must do

Anyone who takes `qmdc.exe` (or the Linux binary) and ships it as
part of a larger product is redistributing a work that dynamically
links libusb. They inherit obligations A–E above with respect
to *their* distribution. Concretely, any downstream product that
bundles qmdc must:

1. **Include the LGPL-2.1 license text** in the final product
   (typically under `Licenses/` inside the installer or in the
   "About" / "Acknowledgements" dialog).
2. **Include an attribution notice** stating that the product
   contains qmdc, which dynamically links libusb under
   LGPL-2.1-or-later. A single paragraph is enough.
3. **Provide access to the exact libusb source** (link to the
   upstream release tag used by qmdc; include any patches that
   exist in `src/qds/libusb/patches/`).
4. **Do not obstruct the user's ability to substitute a modified
   libusb.** Since qmdc uses dynamic linking, the user can simply
   replace `libusb-1.0.dll` / `libusb-1.0.so` with a modified
   version — this satisfies §6(b). Do not pin or signature-check
   the libusb shared library.
5. **Pass obligations further down the chain.** Anyone who takes
   that downstream product and redistributes it inherits the same
   list.

### Example passthrough notice for a downstream product

```
This product contains qmdc (Qualcomm Memory Dump Collector),
https://github.com/qualcomm/qmdc, which is licensed under the
BSD 3-Clause Clear License and dynamically links libusb
(https://libusb.info), licensed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License version 2.1 or (at your option) any later
version.

Copies of both licenses are included in this distribution under
"Licenses/". The corresponding source code of the libusb version
linked into qmdc is available from
https://github.com/libusb/libusb/releases/tag/v1.0.27 . The qmdc
source code is available from
https://github.com/qualcomm/qmdc .

The user may rebuild qmdc against a modified libusb by following
the build instructions in the qmdc repository.
```

## 4. Dynamic linking compliance summary

qmdc now uses dynamic linking for libusb on all platforms. This
satisfies LGPL §6(b) — the "shared library mechanism" — which
means:

- The user can replace `libusb-1.0.dll` (Windows) or
  `libusb-1.0.so` (Linux) with a modified version at any time.
- No object files or relinking scripts need to be shipped.
- Downstream consumers (open- or closed-source) comply with a
  one-line notice + shipping the replaceable shared library.

---

## 5. Change management

- Bumping the vendored libusb version
  - Update the tag / URL in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
  - Re-fetch the upstream `COPYING` and replace
    `LICENSES/libusb-1.0-LGPL-2.1.txt` with the new verbatim copy.
  - Update any release-notes boilerplate that quotes the version.
- Applying a local patch to libusb
  - Put the patch under `src/qds/libusb/patches/NNNN-<description>.patch`.
  - Add a row to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` listing the patch and
    its stated LGPL-2.1 licensing.
  - Ensure the release bundle continues to include the libusb
    source *or* a pointer plus the patch set.
- Removing libusb as a dependency
  - Delete the entries above when it actually leaves the tree.

## 6. Not legal advice

The above captures the project maintainers' best-effort
understanding of what LGPL-2.1 §6 requires of an open-source
consumer that dynamically links libusb. It does not replace review
by your legal team when shipping commercial products.
